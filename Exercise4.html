        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><i>Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.</i></p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><i>Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978.</i> </p>

        <h2><ins>Ferrari</ins></h2>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><i>Ferrari is one of the world’s most admired luxury sports car automakers. The company officially launched in 1947. However, the automaker’s legendary founder and namesake Enzo Ferrari was involved in the industry long before then.</i></p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><i>Born in Modena, Italy in 1898, Enzo Ferrari started out as a race car driver. In the 1920s, he was made a driver with Alfa Romeo and won several racing awards including the 2nd Circuito di Modena. In 1929, Ferrari founded the Scuderia Ferrari, now the official race car division for Ferrari. It began, however, as a division of Alfa that specialized in preparing race cars to gentlemen drivers. This was at a time when sports car racing was really taking off as an activity for the rich and famous, who were really the only ones who could afford it.</i></p>

        <h2><ins>Mustang</ins></h2>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><i>The Ford Mustang is officially unveiled by Henry Ford II at the World’s Fair in Flushing Meadows, New York, on April 17, 1964. That same day, the new car also debuted in Ford showrooms across America and almost 22,000 Mustangs were immediately snapped up by buyers. Named for a World War II fighter plane, the Mustang was the first of a type of vehicle that came to be known as a “pony car.” Ford sold more than 400,000 Mustangs within its first year of production, far exceeding sales expectations. The Mustang was conceived as a “working man’s Thunderbird,” according to Ford. The first models featured a long hood and short rear deck and carried a starting price tag of around $2,300. Ford general manager Lee Iacocca, who became president of the company in October 1964 (and later headed up Chrysler, which he was credited with reviving in the 1980s) was involved in the Mustang’s development and marketing. The car’s launch generated great interest. It was featured on the covers of Newsweek and Time magazines and the night before it went on sale, the Mustang was featured in commercials that ran simultaneously on all three major television networks.</i></p>

        <h2><ins>Porsche</ins></h2>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><i>Coming from humble beginnings, Porsche history dates back to 1948, where founder Ferdinand Porsche created the Porsche brand with just 200 workers. The first Porsche model was introduced later that year, named the Porsche 356, and 52 cars were then produced in 1949 in a small garage. A few years later, in 1952, the automaker released its most popular model yet, the 550 Spyder, and the brand only continued to grow from there, with the 10,000th Porsche vehicle hitting the roads by its 25th anniversary.</i></p>

        <p><i>1948 Porsche 356: The 1948 Porsche 365 was the very first Porsche model, making it an important model in Porsche’s history. 1952 Porsche 550 Spyder: The 550 Spyder was well-liked amongst drivers due to its light-weight body and superior balance. The 550 Spyder was completely redesigned, with the engine now in front of the vehicle’s transmission. 1975 Porsche 911 Turbo 3.0: The original Porsche 911 was a favorite among consumers, and the 1975 Porsche 911 Turbo 3.0 was turbocharged and become the fastest car in Germany at the time. </i></p>
